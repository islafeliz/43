## ⚠️ Patterns Observed:

- Cash-only purchases with no mortgage filings  
- Flipping properties at illogical values (e.g. $950k → $170k)  
- Use of layered LLCs and private trusts  
- Timing aligns with court-enforced liquidation of 43 units in the Dominican Republic  
- Property addresses later used as registered offices for US companies (Ostrava, STZ)
