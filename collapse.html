  <h1>THIS IS NOT A THREAT</h1>
  <p>
    This is the final record of what has happened — and what has already been noticed.<br><br>
    You were the last formal representative of 33 Renova Expert S.R.L.<br>
    Your name appears in the liquidation order of the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic.<br>
    You didn't walk away like the others. You stayed to control what was left.<br><br>
    That was not an accident.<br><br>
    Together with Jarek Tadla, you activated Distinct Investment Holdings LLC.<br>
    A loan was created that was never meant to be repaid.<br>
    You improvised a fake debt.<br><br>
    43 Isla Feliz apartments were not lost — they were taken.<br>
    You architected the transfer.<br>
    You controlled the final documents.<br><br>
    Those assets didn't vanish.<br>
    They transformed — through flips, trusts, shell companies.<br><br>
    They took form as:<br>
    – a 20-acre farm in Ocala<br>
    – land rezoned for commercial use<br>
    – two properties bought for $950,000, flipped for $170,000<br>
    – a multi-family complex bought for $1,980,000 in cash<br>
    – entities: K-9 Specialists, Iguana Palms Landscaping, Ostrava Farm, STZ Group, TZ1 to TZ6<br><br>
    No loans. No disclosures. No taxes.<br>
    Just layered transfers, inflated values, and silence.<br><br>
    You planned this.<br>
    You used shells, nominal owners, and timing synced with Renova's collapse.<br><br>
    This was never meant to surface.<br>
    But chronology, document, signature — they speak.
  </p>

  <h2>I demand one number:</h2>
  <p><strong>120,000 USD</strong> — returned quietly, without commentary.<br>
  You have 5 business days.</p>

  <p class="timer">Time to exposure: <span id="countdown">...</span></p>

  <p>After that, full documentation will be delivered to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>FBI – Financial Crimes Division</li>
    <li>IRS – Criminal Investigations</li>
    <li>OCCRP / ICIJ / ProPublica</li>
    <li>Legal media in the Dominican Republic</li>
    <li>Whistleblower archives</li>
    <li>Former investors, former employees, K-9 and Iguana Palms clients</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>What you built will not be taken.<br>
  It will be revealed.</strong></p>

  <p>Your dogs won’t understand why you’re gone.<br>
  Your wife might.<br>
  Your children will find you in Google.</p>

  <p>I don’t expect a reply.<br>
  But silence will be treated as confirmation.</p>

  <p>I only want one number: <strong>120,000 dollars</strong><br>
  I now allow you to return it. I didn't add interest.</p>
