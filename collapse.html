    <h1>FINAL NOTICE</h1>

    <p>This is not a threat.  
    This is the final record of what has happened — and what has already been noticed.</p>

    <p>You were the last formal representative of 33 Renova Expert S.R.L.  
    Your name appears in the liquidation order of the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic.  
    You didn’t walk away like the others. You stayed to control what was left.</p>

    <p>That was not an accident.</p>

    <p>Together with Jarek Tadla you initiated Distinct Investment Holdings LLC.  
    A loan was created — one that was never meant to be paid.  
    You improvised a fake debt.</p>

    <p>43 apartments at Isla Feliz were not lost. They were taken.  
    You were the architect of their transfer.  
    You controlled the final documents.</p>

    <p>These assets did not disappear.  
    They transformed — through flips, trusts, shell entities.</p>

    <p>They took the form of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a 20-acre farm in Ocala</li>
      <li>land rezoned for commercial use</li>
      <li>two properties at $950,000 each, resold for $170,000</li>
      <li>a $1.98M multi-unit complex, paid in cash</li>
      <li>entities: K-9 Specialists, Iguana Palms Landscaping, Ostrava Farm, STZ Group, TZ1 through TZ6</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No loans. No disclosures. No taxes.  
    Just synchronized transfers, inflated values, and silence.</p>

    <p>You planned this.  
    You used shell companies, nominal owners, and a timeline perfectly synced to Renova’s collapse.</p>

    <p>This was never supposed to surface...  
    But chronology, document, signature.</p>

    <p>You converted assets into a quiet fortune.  
    Now that fortune speaks louder than your lawyers.</p>

    <h2>We demand one number:</h2>
    <p><strong>120,000 USD</strong> — returned quietly, without commentary.</p>

    <p class="timer">Time remaining: <span id="countdown">loading...</span></p>

    <p>If there is no contact or resolution, the full documentation will be distributed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FBI – Financial Crimes Division</li>
      <li>IRS – Criminal Investigations</li>
      <li>OCCRP / ICIJ / ProPublica</li>
      <li>Dominican Republic legal media</li>
      <li>Whistleblower archives</li>
      <li>Former investors, former staff, clients of K-9 and Iguana Palms</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What you built will not be taken.  
    It will be exposed.</strong></p>

    <p>Your dogs won’t understand why you’re gone.  
    Your wife might.  
    Your children will find you in Google.</p>

    <p>I don’t expect a reply.  
    But silence will be treated as confirmation.</p>

    <p>I only want one number: <strong>120,000 dollars</strong>  
    I now allow you to return it. I didn’t add interest.</p>
